    <p>Before beginning phase 0, I would say I had a general idea of what the workload would entail and was pretty optimistic about forming some meaningful connnections and participating in a great experience. Since beginning, i've truly gained a much better appreciation for how little I know about web development and have a much better understanding of the intensity that will surround the nine weeks we're all on site in New York. It really is going to be a mad house!<br><br>

So am I a bit nervous, yes. But watching Shereef's video was a reminder that i'm no longer in the highly competitive, grade-comparing culture of <blockquote id="blockquote"> "If you find a hair in the soup, grab a hairnet for everyone" - Shereef </blockquote>higher education. That's not to say the expectations have lessened, but it does remind me that we're all here for the same reason - we all want to acquire as much knowledge from as many sources as possible to achieve some seriously bad-ass things when we graduate. Keeping that in mind encourages me to ask a cohort a potentially embarrassing coding question, or to loop another person in when i've found a more efficient way of coding a problem, and to generally hold myself to a higher standard because I don't just owe it to myself to take control of my education, as Shereef said - I owe it to my fellow cohorts.<br><br>

This chat with Shereef has only made me more anxious to walk into the madhouse and put on a hairnet. I'm nervous, inspired, anxious, and determined, but pretty excited to see what opportunities follow my time at DBC.
