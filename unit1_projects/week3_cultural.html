				<h1>My learning style</h1>

<p>After retaking the quiz, questioning the results, and retaking it again, i've decided that i'm a mix bewteen concrete random and conrete sequential. I barely scored any points in the abstract random category at all...explains all the stick figures growing up.</p>

<h1>What it means</h1>

<p>I prefer to work independently and oftent times struggle with working in groups, particularly when some degree of dipolomacy is required. I like order, predictability, structure, competition, and using trial-and-error to truly understand and grasp concepts. I am also very much a tactile learner - nothing is going to click for me after reading through web pages and navigating tutorials. However, when i'm on the cmd terminal and putting everything together, that's when things finally start to click.</p>

<h1>How I can leverage this at DBC</h1>

<p>I believe I can leverage these natural tendencies to further enrich my time at DBC in a few ways:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>putting a weekly schedule together during Phase 0 to ensure timely and thorough completion of the challenges</li>
		<li>comparing, reviewing, and benchmarking myself against better programmers in the group to inspire me to learn and achieve more than I am comforatble with</li>
		<li>use trial and error to go beyond the tutorials and challenges and play around in the cmd terminal to test the limits of certain approaches and attempt to find new or better ways to solve a problem</li>
		<li>challenge myself to think of pragmatic, everyday uses for the material that we learn. Potentially apply these learnings in a way that aids our family business</li>
	</ol>
<h1>Biggest challenge(s) so far</h1>

<p>I've been disappointed with my performance so far in two primary areas: time management and individual initiative. I've severely underestimated the time it will take me to achieve a challenge on several occasions, leaving me scrambling and double booked on the weekends leading up to the due date for the challenges. Additionally, I haven't been challenging myself to go above and beyond what the challenge requires to make something that I could truly be proud of. A couple of times, I have submitted a challenge, and then reviewed other superior entries and then went back to better my own, even though I was capable of the second entry the entire time.</p>

<h1>Plan of action</h1>

<p>In order to address these shortcomings (er..struggles), I've made an effort to get a head start on the challenges each week to get to a "comfortable" place by mid-week. When I feel like I am in a good place with my pace for the week, I plan on taking any extra time I have to independently further research the topics at hand and make adjustments to my entries as the week progresses.</p>

 <h1>Growth/Fixed Mindset Reflection</h1>

 <p>I don't love seeing a descriptions in the fixed mindset column and mentally raising my hand, but I think self-improvement has to begin with complete honesty and transparency. Reflecting on the above topics, I learned that I perform better working by myself, often times only push myself when the success of another compels me to, and don't thrive in situtions that lack structure, both socially and professionally.</p> 

 <p>I'm not sure if the "difficultly working well with others" thing stems from a fear of sharing an idea at the risk of being wrong, or from a failure to appreciate the contributions of others, or from a defense mechanism that protects my self-worth in the event that someone else is a better participant in the group than I am, but it's clearly not an ideal way to conduct oneself in any professional context. A potential way to combot this mindset would be to consciously view every group learning activity as knowledge sharing, as opposed to knowledge measuring. In any group context someone will likely know something I don't, and vice versa, so it would only develop my knowledge further by seeking to gain as much from other group members as possible and offering anything I know in return.</p>

 <p>Similarly, the  hurdle I mentioned earlier of waiting for another to perform well before taking the initiative is hampering my learning. It likely stems from some mutation of the law of least effort - as long as I see myself as meeting expectations, I will seek to use the least amount of effort possible to solve a problem or challenge. Once the bar is raised, so then is my effort. The obvious problem with this mindset is that i'll only ever seek to meet perceiced expectations, as opposed to seeking a continually raising internal bar that will further develop my learning and potential. I need to make a conscious effort to set internal expectations for myself in any given situation that are always slighlty above what I think myself capable of, and are as minimally impacted as possible by the perceptions of others.</p>
