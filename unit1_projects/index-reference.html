<body>Hello DBC!
	<p> You can see my cultural blog <a href="http://johnpcain.github.io/unit1_projects/Week3_cultural_blog.html">here!</a>
	</p>
	<p> You can see my technical blog 
	</p>

	<p> Plan for my index.html website: I want to break this down into three stages: wireframe, framework, and polish. During the wireframe stage, 
		I want to think about the user experience and derive inspiration from other blogs and templates that I enjoy reading. During the framework stage, I want to get the rough html structure together, add the content, and apply rough css settings. At this point, I want to spend some time reflecting on the layout and structure and brainstorm different ways to give the blog a more polished and finished look. Afterwards, I'll finish up by applying some sexy css elements and call it a day. </p>
