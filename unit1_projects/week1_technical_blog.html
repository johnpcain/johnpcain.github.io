		<p> Hello everyone! I'm John, and below are my cheerful musings on websites that I enjoy frequenting.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="text">
		<h1> Yahoo!<br><br>
			<p2 class="stuff"> 
  1. I find myself visiting Yahoo more than any other site on a daily basis because the variety and format the site uses to provide news is engaging, convenient, and inclusive. Regardless of the time of day or reading mood I find myself in, I know that i'm bound to come across some article that piques my interest.<br>
  2. The area my eye is initially drawn to is the rotating view of the featured news atricles. For my purposes, I would agree that this is the most important area of the site.<br>
  3. Stimulating, colorful, cluttered, dynamic, engaging<br>
  4. Yahoo! solves many problems, but for me personally, it provides a need for stimulation. I find myself going to the site when I either need a distraction from work, or I have no purpose to be on the internet. The content that I use is the rotating news, covering politics, sports, finance, media, and, most importantly, celebrity gossip.<br>
  5. informative, silly, easy reading, stimulating, nonsense. I would say the "eye-candy" appeal of the website generally translates into easy-reading, substance-lacking content.<br>
  6. Generally pretty easy to navigate the news, but if you are looking for a prior news article that you may have read earlier in the day, you sometimes have to leave the website and do an external google search.<br> 
  7. Very easy - to me, the most compelling reason to visit the site. <br>
  8. Somewhere between "I'm glad I have a better idea of what's going on in the world" and "why did I just waste five minutes reading about Jay-Z and Sologne fighting in an elevator"<br>
  9. Yahoo! does have a store component to the website, but i've never purchased anything through it. To me, Yahoo! is merely a news provider, and I have never considered using the site as anything more. <br>
			</p2>
		</h1>
    <h1> MarketWatch!<br><br>
      <p3 class="stuff">
      1. Important, relevant financial news in an easily navigated format<br>
2. The featured news headline. I would say that the featured headline, along with the featured sub-stories, are the most important aspects to the site<br>
3. cluttered, numeric, bland, structured, static<br>
4. It solves the problem of the need to access timely and relevant financial news. The conent is primarily concerned with market moves, earnings reports, business analyses, etc. <br>
5. dry, informative, substantial, intelligent, dramatic. I would expect this content from the visual adjectives I provided earlier.<br>
6. Generally not easy to find what i'm looking for. Articles move, stories are hidden, but that is a nature of a news website I suppose.<br>
7. Browsing the content could be improved. Difficult to immediately distinguish ads from content, a problem worsened by basic, irrelevant graphics that accompany the stories.<br>
8. I feel good about the time I spent reading the content. I never get "lost" in MarketWatch, as I will on Yahoo! or Facebook. The content is too dry for me to lose track of time. <br>
9. I don't believe it sells anything, and I haven't made any purchases. Similar to Yahoo!, I don't enter the website prepared to make a purchasing decision. <br>
   </p3>
  </h1>
  <h1> RealClearPoltics!<br><br>
    <p4 class="stuff">
      1. RCP presents a nonpartisan, relevant and approachable way to remain up-to-date on politics<br>
2. My eye is initially drawn to the single advertisement that the website shows on the homepage. Clearly, this is not the most important content. The ad graphic is nice though, not too busy or distracting. <br>
3. Ogranized, structured, dynamic, approachable, and very...red<br>
4. Problem - how to get the political facts without the spin in a timely and organized fashion<br>
5. Serious, matter-of-fact, stimulating, provocative, thought-provoking. The content can be loud and provocative, which isn't necesarily shown in the website's aesthetics.<br>
6. Very easy, best of the three i've reviewed. Navigating through this site is a breeze. <br>
7. Browsing not as easy. Clicking the links will take you to an external page. The user then has to click the back button to return to the homepage. <br>
8. Informed, stimulated, energized. <br>
9. The site does not sell anything, and I never go to the site prepared to make a purchase. <br>
