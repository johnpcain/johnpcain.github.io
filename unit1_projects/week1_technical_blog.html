    <p>After reviewing the my choices and responses, i've decided that I need to expand the variety of websites that I visit. Anyways, here is a list of a few that I chose:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a></li>
  		  <li><a href="www.realclearpolitics.com">RealClearPolitics!</a></li>
			  <li><a href="www.marketwatch.com">MarketWatch!</a></li>
      </ul><br><br>
    </p>
    <h1> Yahoo!
      <p> I find myself visiting Yahoo more than any other site on a daily basis because the variety and format the site uses to provide news is engaging, convenient, and inclusive. Regardless of the time of day or reading mood I find myself in, I know that i'm bound to come across some article that piques my interest.<br><br>

The area my eye is initially drawn to is the rotating view of the featured news atricles. For my purposes, I would agree that this is the most important area of the site.<br><br>

My initial impression of the website aesthetics are that they are stimulating, colorful, cluttered, dynamic, and engaging<br><br>

Yahoo! solves many problems, but for me personally, it provides a need for stimulus. I find myself going to the site when I either need a distraction from work, or I have no purpose to be on the internet. The content that I use is the rotating news, covering politics, sports, finance, media, and, most importantly, celebrity gossip.<br><br>

The content on this site mostly lacks substance. Generally, I find it to be marginally informative, silly, easy reading, stimulating, but more often than not, just nonsense. I would say the "eye-candy" appeal of the website generally translates into easy-reading, substance-lacking content.<br><br>

I find it generally pretty easy to navigate the news, but if you are looking for a prior news article that you may have read earlier in the day, you sometimes have to leave the website and do an external google search.<br><br>

Navigating through this website is a breez. It's very easy - to me, the most compelling reason to visit the site. <br><br>

When I leave the site, the impression that I am left with is somewhere between "I'm glad I have a better idea of what's going on in the world" and "why did I just waste five minutes reading about Jay-Z and Sologne fighting in an elevator"<br><br>

Yahoo! does have a store component to the website, but i've never purchased anything through it. To me, Yahoo! is merely a news provider, and I have never considered using the site as anything more. <br><br>

    <h1> Market Watch
      <p> 
MarketWatchg solves the need for important, relevant financial news in an easily navigated format <br><br>

My eye is initially drawn toards the featured news headline. I would say that the featured headline, along with the featured sub-stories, are the most important aspects to the site<br><br>

Aesthetically, I find it the site to be cluttered, numeric, bland, structured, and static<br><br>

The site solves the the need to access timely and relevant financial news. The conent is primarily concerned with market moves, earnings reports, business analyses, etc. <br><br>

I find the content to be dry, informative, substantial, intelligent, dramatic. I would expect this content from the visual adjectives I provided earlier.<br><br>

Generally, it's not very easy to find what i'm looking for. Articles move, stories are hidden, but that is a nature of a news website I suppose<br><br>

Browsing the content could be improved. Difficult to immediately distinguish ads from content, a problem worsened by basic, irrelevant graphics that accompany the stories.<br><br>

I feel good about the time I spent reading the content. I never get "lost" in MarketWatch, as I will on Yahoo! or Facebook. The content is too dry for me to lose track of time. <br><br>

I don't believe Marketwatch sells anything, and I haven't made any purchases. Similar to Yahoo!, I don't enter the website prepared to make a purchasing decision. <br><br>

    </h1>
    <h1> RealClearPolitics
      <p> RCP presents a nonpartisan, relevant and approachable way to remain up-to-date on politics<br><br>

My eye is initially drawn to the single advertisement that the website shows on the homepage. Clearly, this is not the most important content. The ad graphic is nice though, not too busy or distracting. <br><br>

Aesthetically, I find the site to be ogranized, structured, dynamic, approachable, and very...red<br><br>

It solves the age old problem of how to get political facts without a spin in a timely and organized fashion<br><br>

The content and feel of the site is serious, matter-of-fact, stimulating, provocative, and thought-provoking. The content can be loud and provocative, which isn't necesarily shown in the website's aesthetics.<br><br>

it's very easy to navigate the home page, the best of the three i've reviewed. Navigating through this site is a breeze. <br><br>

Browsing through hte site is not as easy. Clicking the links will take you to an external page. The user then has to click the back button to return to the homepage. <br><br>

Informed, stimulated, energized. <br><br>

The site does not sell anything, and I never go to the site prepared to make a purchase. <br><br>
