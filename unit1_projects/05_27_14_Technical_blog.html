				<h1> Javascript: world domination, or programmer frustration?</h1>
				<p>	Javascript is an object-oriented programming language that was developed by Netscape in 1995 (originally called "LiveScript") to run on Netscape Navigator, Netscape's browser. Javascript, though originally a rather weak programming language, ran on Navigator with success and subsequently became standard equipment in virtually all web browsers. Javascript's popularity, or ubibquity, is mostly due to its role as the scripting language of the www. RedBank recently determined that Javascript was the most widely-usued programming language by analyzing data from GitHub and Stack Overflow on project file types and tags. </p>
				<h1>Misunderstood</h1>
				<p> Despite its ubiquity, there is a prevailing sense among many programmers that Javascript is primarily for amaeturs. This likely results from the language's ease of use - many amateurs do tend to gravitate towards Javascript, but the language is still heavily capable and is certainly a professional tool for all programmers. Another common misconception is that Javascript is somehow related to Java. The two programs were developed by separate companies and have about as much in common as C and Java do. Javascript is much, much more powerful. Lastly, many assume that Javascript is used almost solely in browsers. Again, this is not the case. Javascript is also used other programs, to name a few: Photoshop, PDF editors, Dreamweaver. </p>
				<h1>Object-oriented</h1>
				<p>In Javascript, everything is an object. Any object can contain any property at any point in time. Additionally, these properties can be accessed in different ways (e.g. "." or "[]").</p>
				<h1>Conjunction, Conjuction. What's your function?</h1>
				<p>Functions in Javascript are just different. A function is able to accept any number of arguments and return any value. This feature reduces a lot of code throughout the course of a project.</p>
				<h1>Primary Advantages</h1>
					<ol>
						<li>Speed: Javascript is client-side. This means that code functions may be run immediately instead of having to wait to connect with an external server</li>
						<li> Ease-of-use: Javascript is relatively easy to learn and its syntax is relatively close to plain English</li>
						<li>Versatility: Javascript can be used in any web page, regardless of file extension. Third party add-ons enable users to insert snippets of Javascript to execute on any web page</li>
					</ol>
				<h1>Primary Disadvantages</h1>
					<ol>
						<li>Security: because Javascript runs on the user's computer (client-side) and executes immediately, malacious code can be executed and cause harm to the users's computer. </li>
						<li>Too many versions: So many versions of Javascript exist, due to updates, that it can cause confusion</li>
						<li>Inconsistency: there is no universal standard for rendering Javascript, though programmers are working towards one. As a result, different layout engines may render Javascript differently and display varying functionalities and interface. </li>
						<li>Inheritances: Javascript only allows single inheritance; multiple inheritances are not allowed</li>
					</ol>
				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>Javascript isn't going anywhere - and that appears to be for the best. The programming tide seems to be trending towards reducing dependency on servers and asking more of the user's computer - Javascript will serve as an indispensible tool in enabling this. </p>
