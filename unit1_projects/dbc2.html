		<p2>Vault Brewing Company is like no brewery or brewpub you’ve ever experienced.   	<blockquote id="blockquote"> "This is a brewery for the people, by the people" - Someone who works there
    </blockquote>We are located in the quaint town of Yardley in Bucks County, Pennsylvania but provide an atmosphere more akin to the speakeasies of Philadelphia. We do not consider ourselves a bar, a pub, or even a traditional brewery. Our goal is to re-envision the concept of a brewpub and create an experience that is truly unique.</br> Upon arriving and walking through our “faux vault entryway,” you’ll notice that the entire brewery and wood-fired kitchen oven are completely open to view. The brewery sits directly behind the bar and the kitchen is adjacent to the dining tables. The décor is a combination of regal bank, stark industrial, old-world, and modern.
