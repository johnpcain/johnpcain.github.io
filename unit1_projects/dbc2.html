		<p2>Vault Brewing Company is like no brewery or brewpub you’ve ever experienced.   	<blockquote id="blockquote"> "This is a brewery for the people, by the people" - <i>Someone who works there</i>
    </blockquote>We are located in the quaint town of Yardley in Bucks County, Pennsylvania but provide an atmosphere more akin to the speakeasies of Philadelphia. We do not consider ourselves a bar, a pub, or even a traditional brewery. Our goal is to re-envision the concept of a brewpub and create an experience that is truly unique.</br> Upon arriving and walking through our “faux vault entryway,” you’ll notice that the entire brewery and wood-fired kitchen oven are completely open to view. The brewery sits directly behind the bar and the kitchen is adjacent to the dining tables. The décor is a combination of regal bank, stark industrial, old-world, and modern.  For images of the interior, click <a href="http://vaultbrewing.com/photos/"title="Vault Photos">Here</a><br><br>
    Our menu is intentionally focused yet varied.  We have a small selection of tapas, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and desserts. Everything you find on the menu is either made in-house or sourced locally, nothing is ever frozen or reheated, and every “in-house” ingredient is made fresh daily. The menu will rotate seasonally so be on the lookout for new items as the weather changes.<br><br>

Our beer is unfiltered and brewed on-site in our 310 gallon (10bbl) brewery. We brew twice a week and each batch rarely lasts more than a month. Our beer lines run directly from the serving tanks behind the bar may be served via draft (traditional CO2), nitro (think Guinness-style), or cask (low-carbonation, warmer temperature, English-style).<br><br>

Our license restricts us from selling out of state wines but we happily provide local wine from Crossing Vineyards and Winery. For more information on the available wines, click here.<br><br>

We invite you to grab a fresh beer, a piece of pizza, and explore your surroundings. We only ask that you keep an open mind and a thirsty palate.
