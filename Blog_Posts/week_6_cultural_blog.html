				<h1> Stereotype Threat: We've all experienced it to some degree </h1>
					<p> When I initially began researching the subject, I was primarily considering the more obvious and pernicious instances of stereotype threats - an African-American person who feels academically inferior, a woman who feels she is less able at driving, or an Asian person who feels inferior at sports. But as I began considering the topic, I realized that we've all subjected ourselves to stereotype threat, varying in degree and severity. To me, it seems stereotype threat is as much about telling yourself where you should excel as it is about telling youself where you shouldn't excel </p>
					<p> When I was 18 and considering what I wanted to do with my life, my race, socio-economic level, and family status strongly impacted what I thought I should be doing. I felt that because I was raised in a white, affluent family, I was expected to get a business degree that would allow me to get a respectable job with high income potential.<p>

					<p>I had many other interests at the time - teaching, public service, writing - but I felt subconsciously that I shouldn't be pursuing those careers, even though they may have been more rewarding and fulfilling. I spent four years pursuing a business degree, five summers adding marketing internships to my resume, and two years as a consultant before I allowed myself to consider what I actually wanted to do with my life, independent of what I felt what expected of me. </p>
				<h2> What can we do about it? </h2>
					<p> Stereotype threats stem from the perceived expectations imposed on an individual. The individual, then, is more likely to consider those expectations in how one view themselves and allow those expectations to impact their achievements and life decisions. I think attempting to tamper stereotypes would be a very difficult undertaking, and unlikely to produce any significant results. I believe the right approach to limiting the effects of stereotype threats is to modify the degree to which an individual allows themselves to be impacted by the perceptions of others. I think this can be achieved by helping individuals establish an indentity that is independent of their race, socio-economic status, or gender. </p>
					<p> While any approach that furthers this end is helpful, I think that the best opportunity for affecting significant change would be to modify programs that touch an individual in their formative years (e.g. teaching, testing, nurturing, etc.). The less we associate ourselves with our race, gender, nationality, or degree of wealth, the less vulnerable we'll all be to stereotype threat in any form. </p>
