				<h1> The damaging effects of stereotype threats </h1>
					<p> I feel fortunate that it was very difficult for me to think of instances where i've been the victim of a stereotype threat. I was raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia as a French-Canadian... apart from being the occasional butt of a joke (For sale: French WWII Rifle - never fired and only dropped once), I never really felt that expectations were lowered of me because of my race, gender, or socio-economic status. I have, however, witnessed the pernicious effects of stereotype threats in observing family, friends, and colleagues. </p>
					<p> I have an Egyptian friend who works in the field of consulting. He's a bright guy - he received his MBA from Simon Business School and works for a large consulting firm. Recently, he and I were chatting about consulting and he expressed that he wished he could do Management Consulting (or "sexy" consulting, as he called it). He thought it was better pay, more interesting work, and provided a better work environment. When I asked why he didn't pursue it, he kind of brushed it off and said that firms weren't looking for guys like him to walk them them through powerpoints (because English was his second language and he looked Middle-Eastern). That, is stereotype threat. My friend was associating himself with a relevant social category and engaging in self-handicapping behavior. </p>
				<h1> What can we do about it? </h1>
					<p> Stereotype threats stem from the perceived expectations imposed on an individual. The individual, then, is more likely to consider those expectations in how one view themselves and allow those expectations to impact their achievements and life decisions. I think attempting to tamper stereotypes would be a very difficult undertaking, and unlikely to produce any significant results. I believe the right approach to limiting the effects of stereotype threats is to modify the degree to which an individual allows themselves to be impacted by the perceptions of others. I think this can be achieved by helping individuals establish an indentity that is independent of their race, socio-economic status, or gender. </p>
					<p> While any approach that furthers this end is helpful, I think that the best opportunity for affecting significant change would be to modify programs that touch an individual in their formative years (e.g. teaching, testing, nurturing, etc.). The less we associate ourselves with our race, gender, nationality, or degree of wealth, the less vulnerable we'll all be to stereotype threat in any form. </p>
