				<h1> Cyber Security: You may have more "friends" than you think. </h1>
					<p> Baring news of a massive data breach (e.g. Target late 2013) or the leaking of classified information by a cyber vigilante, the average internet user spends very little time considering security holes in software, potential exposures to malicious viruses, or the potential misuse of personal information. This mindset is largely driven by blind trust in software and tech companies and general apathy towards cyber crimes and data breaches. However, our data is not as secure as we think, and it would behoove us to consider ways of improving the status quo. </p>

					<p> Currently, few privacy regulations exist that set forth standards for how tech companies may handle, store, and distribute user data. Consequently, many companies are less that forthcoming about their data policies and less than transparent about how they use personal data. This problem is amplified by the wide usage of social media, where personal technology users are more apt than before to share private information without a complete understanding of how it may be used, where it it stored, or who may have access to it. </p>


				<h1> Cyber security by the numbers </h1>
					<p> Our data is only as secure as the systems that protect it and the devices that store it. A few examples below will serve to demonstrate how easily data can be mishandled: </h1>
					<ul>
						<li> A recent survey of IT professionals showed that one in five still had access to the prior employer's IT systems </li>
						<li> 28% of corporate data is stored on an endpoint user device, as opposed to a a remote server. </li>
						<li> A couple of years ago, a contractor for Howard University Hospital lost a laptop with medical records of more than 34,000 patients</li>
						<li>Last fall, a stolen unencrypted laptop from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center exposed medical records of 250,000 patients</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Furthermore, the fallout resulting from data mishandling can be devestating. The Global Economic Symposium estimated that the average cost of recovering a data brach at $7.2 million. <p>

				<h1> What can be done? </h1>
					<p> There are serveral stakeholders that have a role in data privacy and cyber security. Namely, those stakeholders are government, industry, users, and law enforcement. Below, i've outlined what each can do to help close security holes and improve awareness: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <b>Government</b>: our regulatory bodies need to be procative in developing thorough data privacy regulation that balances industry input in a way that benefits the user but doesn't stifle the company with unnecessary bureaucracy. We also need to do more to develop international cyber security norms that outline codes of conduct, penalize those who breach them, and force every country into compyling with international norms to squash potential safe havens for malicious hackers. </li>
						<li> <b>Industry</b>: tech companies should be more transparent and upfront with users about how they are employing personal data they collect. They should seek to cooperate and share best practices with one another to promote better cyber security and minimize the impact of a future data breaches. Tech companies should also be less quick to rush a product to market that hasn't been thoroughly vetted for potential bugs or security holes. </li>
						<li> <b>Users</b>: web users need to take more ownership and accountability for their personal data. They should be asking questions, demanding answers, better monitor their personal accounts to detect fraud, and better communicate with the authorities to prevent mass small-cap fraudulent schemes. </li>
						<li> <b>Law Enforcement</b>: law enforcement needs to be as proactive is pursuing small-cap fraud as they have been with large-cap fraud. Criminals have discovered that it is much easier to steal $1 from one million people than it is to steal $1 million from one person. Furthermore, they guys stealing $10 from your paypal account are likely the same guys capable of pulling off much larger and coordinated cyber attaks. </li>
					</ul>
