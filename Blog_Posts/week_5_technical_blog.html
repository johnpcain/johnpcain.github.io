				<h1> Class Methods vs. Instance Methods </h1>
				<p> I chose to discuss this topic because I was, at first, pretty intimidated by the use of "self." and didn't quite understand why one would choose to use one method over the other.</p>
				<p> In ruby-speak, class methods are only available on the class itself, whereas instance methods are only available on instances of the class. To bring it down to earth a bit, think of classes as humans, and instances as individual people (you and me). Let's say we wanted to calculate the height of Jim Carrey. We wouldn't want to call a .height method on Humans, because the options are limitless. Instead, we would want to call the .height method on an instance of a Human. Human.new(Jim_Carrey).height </p>

				<p> No, height isn't a real method, but I think we both get the point. Generally speaking, it's best practice to use instance methods when writing code that involves logic or operations. Class methods are used when you don't have an instance available to you, or for things that don't operate on an individual instance of a model. The most common use of a class method is to quickly create an new, uninitialized instance, using +alloc for shorthand. There are several ways to create class methods, but the most common and my personal favorite is: </p>

				<p> Here, we are using "self." before the method "bar" to indicate that we are calling the method on the class itself. If we call Foo.bar, then Ruby knows to apply the method "bar" to the "Foo" class. However, if we call the method "baz", we receive an error, because the method requires an instance of the class. </p>

<!-- class Human
	def height (name)
		return name.height
	end
end

Human.new(Jim_Carrey).height


class Foo
	def self.bar
		puts "this is a class method"
	end

	def baz
		puts "this is an instance method"
end

Foo.bar # "this is a class method"
Foo.baz # undefined method "baz"

Foo.new.baz # "this is an instance method" -->
