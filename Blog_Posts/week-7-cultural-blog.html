				<h1> Values, Happiness, and Self-Worth </h1>
				<p> A few values immediately jumped out at me - affirmation, competence, self-knowledge, achievement - because they all dance around a similar sensation. I'm reminded of a part from "The Fountainhead" where the hero, the brilliant architect, is witnessed lying on the grass - "like a cat" -  enjoying perfect and deserved repose. What I like about that scene is it captures that wonderful feeling we all experience after accomplishing something difficult, challenging and consequential. It goes beyond "I think i've earned myself a beer", and instills a lasting self-worth that both allows us to take a miunte and truly enjoy a moment's rest but then soon drives us to push even harder. </p>

				<p> Do I try to live up to those values? Short answer - on a good day, yes. I'll give myself a 3.5 on a scale of 1 - 5. <p>

				<h1> Advice </h1>

				<p> I don't get asked for advice very often, admittedly. The last time someone asked me for serious advice was about six months ago where a good friend asked me my opinion on whether he should open a semi-service restaurant. I have a lot of experience in the service industry, so I attempted to dispel any rosy expectations he might have in hopes of dissuading him. Result: he opened it anyway and is actually doing really well. Moral of the story: don't come to me for adivce, I guess? </p>

				<h1> Values and stereotype threat </h1> 
				<p> When I think about my values, I can't help but notice that my desire for self-improvement and knowlege-building was likely influenced by what I felt others expected of me. As such, I feel as if I have yet to live up to those values and expectations. But, rather than be discouraged or disheartened by these thoughts, i'm usually uplifted by a belief that, as long as I work hard, i'll eventually find myself in a place where I feel i'm living up to those values. </p>
