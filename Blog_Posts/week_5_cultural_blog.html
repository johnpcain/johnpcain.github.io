				<h1> My thoughts regarding pairing </h1>
					<p> The first few pairing sessions weren't terribly productive for me. I think this is partially due to the lack of technical work that my partner and I could pair on (most sessions turned into co-learning sessions), but as we graduated into actual coding, I initially struggled with working within the driver/navigator structure. As navigator, I was hesitant to give too much guidance at the risk of coming across as dictating code. As such, I think I withheld input and either appeared disengaged and the session was less productive as a result.</p>
					<p> Pairing is definitely getting more productive and coming easier to me as the sessions progress. I've paired multiple times with several students and found that, after we developed a rapport, it was very easy for us to jump into the problem and glide in and out of driver/navigator roles with relative ease. I've found that taking the time initially to develop rapport and demonstrate respect pays dividends as the pair progresses into the more challenging aspects of a problem later in the pairing session. </p>
				<h1> My thoughts regarding feedback </h1>
					<p> Of course, reading positive feedback is fun. It affirms how one likely sees themself and provides a nice little ego boost. Alternatively, the mixed feedback/negative feedback is initially less fun, but i'm glad we spent the time earlier reviewing growth/fixed mindset, because my awareness of the distinction bucks any negative instinctive reaction to reading constructive feedback. I'm not really having any trouble reading the feedback, recognizing any shortcomings, and making mental notes to correct those in the future. According to the feedback i've received so far, I need to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li> Be more forthcoming with input when acting as navigator </li>
							<li> Do a better job of communicating respect for the ideas of others </li>
							<li> Always appear and remain engaged, regardless of how tedious the task at hand </li>
							<li> Take more initiative with exploring external resources to discover answers or find direction </li>
							<li> Resist the urge to jump into the problem without thinking through a framework for approaching the problem  </li>
						</ul>
					<p> I'm loving the feedback framework, and look forward to finding better ways to improve the way I work with people. This is big for me, because my entire life i've always held the mindset of Buzz Lightyear... "I work alone". Changing that mindset is a big to-do item for me during DBC. </p>
